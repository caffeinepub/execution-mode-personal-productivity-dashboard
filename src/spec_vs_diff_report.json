  "summary": "REQ-2 (daily quote refresh on day change) appears implemented via day-rollover detection that updates the React Query key while preserving the existing localStorage cache keys. REQ-1 (desktop breakpoint/layout fix in Dashboard) is not evidenced by the provided diff summary—no Dashboard layout/class changes are shown, and no clear fix targeting the dashboard’s lg:grid-cols behavior is visible.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the responsive layout so the dashboard renders its intended desktop layout on large screens (e.g., lg:grid-cols-2 and lg:grid-cols-3 in frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx) instead of remaining in a phone/mobile layout on desktop, without changing the existing visual design, component structure, or content.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no modifications to frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (or other clearly related layout files) where the lg:* grid classes are applied/expected. Tailwind config changes are shown, but there is no direct evidence that the dashboard layout issue was addressed.",

      "description": "Documentation/state updates describing numerous UI/feature enhancements (e.g., theme settings gear icon, neon glow effects, notification manager behavior, PWA/service worker enhancements) unrelated to the requested desktop breakpoint fix and daily quote day-change refresh.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly limits scope to desktop breakpoint responsiveness and DailyQuote day-rollover refresh, and lists non-goals including adding new features or redesign/styling changes. The diff includes updates to a summary file and project state entries that reference broader enhancements not requested.",
